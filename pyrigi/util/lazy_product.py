def lazy_product[T, R](iter1: Iterator[T], iter2: Iterator[R]) -> Iterator[Tuple[T, R]]:
    """
    Alternative for itertools.product that exhausts bot the iterators in parallel.
    In the standard implementation first the first iterator is exhausted
    and then second element of the other iterator is read.
    Here both the iterators switch roles in who takes the next element.

    This function is slightly slower and requires more memory as it's not
    written in C, on the other hand it can provide some combinations
    sooner and some sooner terminating algorithms may find it beneficial.
    Also the itertools.product is blocking (it waits for the result),
    this is not.

    Returns
    -------
        The same as itertools.product, but in different order.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a, b = [1, 2, 3], ["a", "b", "c"]
    >>> list(itertools.product(a, b))
    [(1, 'a'), (1, 'b'), (1, 'c'),
     (2, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (2, 'c'),
     (3, 'a'), (3, 'b'), (3, 'c')]

    >>> list(lazy_product(a, b)
    [(1, 'a'), (2, 'a'), (1, 'b'),
     (2, 'b'), (3, 'a'), (3, 'b'),
     (1, 'c'), (2, 'c'), (3, 'c')]
